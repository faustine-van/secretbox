## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or higher)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- [Supabase Account](https://supabase.com/)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/secretbox.git
cd secretbox
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Set Up Supabase

1.  Create a new project on [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).
2.  Navigate to the **SQL Editor** and run the schemas from the `schemas` directory in the following order:
    - `01_create_user_profiles.sql`
    - `02_create_collections.sql`
    - `03_create_keys.sql`
    - `04_create_audit_logs.sql`
    - `05_rls_policies.sql`
    - `06_triggers.sql`
3.  Navigate to **Project Settings** > **API** and copy your **Project URL** and **anon key**.

### 4. Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and add the following environment variables:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-project-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
ENCRYPTION_KEY=a-secure-32-byte-encryption-key # Must be 32 bytes
```

You can generate a secure 32-byte key using the following command:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

### 5. Run the Development Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
