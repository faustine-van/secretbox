# 🔐 SecretBox - Secure Key Manager

A **developer-focused secret key management application** that helps developers and teams securely store, organize, and retrieve sensitive credentials such as **API keys, tokens, and database credentials**.  

SecretBox prioritizes **security, usability, and scalability**, making it practical for both personal workflows and team collaboration.

## 🔖 Project Overview

### What We’re Building
A secure key management solution built for developers, integrating **server-side encryption, collections-based organization, and audit logging**.  

### Who It’s For
- Developers managing multiple API keys and credentials  
- Teams needing secure, shared credential storage  
- Anyone looking for an alternative to storing secrets in plaintext files or environment variables  

### Why It Matters
- **Solves a real problem**: Credentials are often scattered, insecure, or hard to manage.  
- **Demonstrates technical depth**: Strong focus on security, full-stack design, and scalability.  
- **Personally useful**: Designed to improve developer workflows while serving as a portfolio-worthy project.

## 🤖 AI Integration Strategy

### 1. Code Generation
AI tools will be used to **scaffold components, APIs, and utilities**:
- Generate **React components** with TypeScript props & Tailwind styles  
- Scaffold **Next.js API routes** with validation & error handling  
- Create **Supabase migrations and RLS policies**  
- Generate **utility functions** (e.g., encryption/decryption)  

**Example prompts**:  
- Generate CRUD API for keys with encryption & logging  
- Build `KeyCard` component with reveal/hide, copy-to-clipboard, and accessibility features  

---

### 2. Testing
AI will assist in **test creation & coverage**:
- **Unit Tests** → Encryption logic, validation schemas  
- **Integration Tests** → API routes (auth, rate limits)  
- **Component Tests** → Forms, key display components  
- **E2E Tests** → Full flows (login, key creation, retrieval)  

**Tools:** Jest, React Testing Library, Playwright  
**AI Role:** Generate edge cases, mock data factories, async handling  

---

### 3. Documentation
AI will support **up-to-date project documentation**:
- Generate and maintain **docstrings and inline comments**  
- Create structured **README.md** and usage examples  
- Suggest **PR descriptions and commit messages**  

---

### 4. Context-Aware Techniques
To make AI output more accurate, context will be provided through:
- **API specs & database schemas** → Generate type-safe API clients  
- **File trees & diffs** → Suggest refactoring or test coverage  
- **Commit history** → Automate changelog and PR templates
