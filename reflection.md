# SecretBox Reflection

What worked well while using AI for this project
- 

### what felt limiting while using AI for this project
- Because I was using the free version of gemini, i was limited in the number of requests i could make per day.
which caused to change from login by auth google to login by api key again and again.
- Even if it was exhausted, i was able to get the desired results.

### what you learned about prompting, reviewing, and iterating
- Need to be more specific in the prompts i gave to the AI.
- Need to be prepared enough to handle the limitations of the free version of gemini.
- The more you not specific in the prompt, the more likely it will not generate the desired results. and sometimes you might be lost or lost what you have done better.  

### What could have been done better
- Be more specific in the prompts i gave to the AI.
- Review the code generated by the AI and make sure it meets the requirements.
- Iterate on the prompts and code until i get the desired results. which i did but i was not sure if it was the best way to do it.
