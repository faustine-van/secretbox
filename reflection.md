# SecretBox Reflection

### What Worked Well

-   **Prompt-Driven Scaffolding:** Detailed, multi-step prompts were highly effective. They allowed me to scaffold the Next.js project, set up the database schema, and generate the core application structure with high accuracy and speed.

-   **AI-Assisted Debugging:** I successfully diagnosed and fixed several tricky bugs together. This included resolving the infinite loading state by refactoring the `useAuth` hook and fixing the repeated API calls by applying the `useCallback` hook correctly. This shows a strong human-AI partnership in troubleshooting.

-   **Iterative Development:** Building the application feature-by-feature (auth, then keys, then collections) was a very effective strategy. It allowed me to focus on one part of the system at a time, making development and debugging much more manageable.

-   **Clear Project Guidelines:** The `GEMINI.md` file was crucial. It provided a clear set of rules and conventions that I could follow, ensuring the generated code was consistent with your project's standards for security, quality, and style.

-   **Testing Integration:** I successfully integrated a comprehensive testing suite with Jest and Playwright, establishing a solid foundation for ensuring the application's reliability and catching regressions.

### What Felt Limiting

-   **API Rate Limiting:** Because I was using the free version of gemini, i was limited in the number of requests I could make per day. which caused to change from login by auth google to login by api key again and again.
-   **Resilience:** Even if it was exhausted, i was able to get the desired results.

### What I Learned

-   **Specificity is Key:** Need to be more specific in the prompts i gave to the AI. The more you not specific in the prompt, the more likely it will not generate the desired results. and sometimes you might be lost or lost what you have done better.  
-   **Handling Limitations:** Need to be prepared enough to handle the limitations of the free version of gemini.

### What Could Have Been Done Better

-   **More Specific Prompts:** Be more specific in the prompts i gave to the AI.
-   **Thorough Code Reviews:** Review the code generated by the AI and make sure it meets the requirements.
-   **Iterative Refinement:** Iterate on the prompts and code until i get the desired results. which i did but i was not sure if it was the best way to do it.
